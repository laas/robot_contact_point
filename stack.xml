  <description brief="Robot contact point">

    Robot contact point stack aims at providing a format and a parser
    in which one can define what are the allowed contact points for a
    robot. I.e. where are the area which can be used as a support and
    how much they can sustain.

    This stack defines the RCPDF (Robot Contact Point Definition
    Format) as XML mini-language derived from the URDF syntax.
